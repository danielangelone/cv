## Introduction

Front-End Developer specialized in UX/UI, dedicated to creating high-quality digital experiences. Throughout my professional journey, I have developed proficiency in all phases of dynamic web project cycles. My skills encompass a wide range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript, as well as advanced usage of frameworks like Bootstrap and Material.

With a results-oriented approach and a focus on technical excellence, my journey includes significant contributions to challenging projects. From website maintenance to the development of comprehensive intranets for prominent institutions, I apply my expertise to create solutions that combine aesthetics, functionality, and efficiency.

My familiarity with essential Graphic Design tools, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, and Adobe XD, enables me to transform concepts into tangible and visually appealing interfaces. Additionally, my experience with version control systems like Git ensures effective collaboration and precise change tracking.

I maintain a continuous commitment to learning and improvement. I believe that success in technology demands tireless innovation alongside an analytical, data-driven approach. My dedication to usability, performance, and quality is evident in every project I undertake.

I look forward to contributing in challenging and collaborative environments, where I can apply my skills to drive excellence in user experience and Front-End development.
